# My Cozy Laravel Neovim Setup

Hey there! üëã This is my carefully crafted Neovim configuration that I've been using and refining while working on Laravel projects. After trying countless setups and configurations, this one finally feels just right - it's fast, smart, and makes Laravel development a breeze.

What makes it special? It's got everything I need for Laravel work - from super-smart PHP completion to Blade template support, and it handles all those little things that used to slow me down. And yes, it works great with Tailwind CSS too!

I originally built this for myself, but figured it might help other Laravel devs who want to give Neovim a shot. Trust me, once you get this set up, you'll wonder how you ever coded Laravel projects without it.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:

1. Neovim (version 0.8.0 or higher)
   ```bash
   # For macOS (using Homebrew)
   brew install neovim

   # For Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install neovim

   # For Windows (using Chocolatey)
   choco install neovim
   ```

2. Node.js (required for CoC)
   ```bash
   # For macOS
   brew install node

   # For Ubuntu/Debian
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
   sudo apt install nodejs

   # For Windows
   choco install nodejs
   ```

3. Git
   ```bash
   # For macOS
   brew install git

   # For Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install git

   # For Windows
   choco install git
   ```

4. Ripgrep (for better search functionality)
   ```bash
   # For macOS
   brew install ripgrep

   # For Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install ripgrep

   # For Windows
   choco install ripgrep
   ```

## Installation

1. First, install vim-plug (Plugin Manager):
   ```bash
   # For Unix (Linux/macOS)
   sh -c 'curl -fLo "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}"/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim'

   # For Windows (PowerShell)
   iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim |`
       ni "$env:LOCALAPPDATA/nvim-data/site/autoload/plug.vim" -Force
   ```

2. Create the Neovim configuration directory:
   ```bash
   # For Unix (Linux/macOS)
   mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim

   # For Windows
   mkdir $env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim
   ```

3. Copy the provided `init.vim` into your Neovim configuration directory:
   ```bash
   # For Unix (Linux/macOS)
   cp init.vim ~/.config/nvim/

   # For Windows
   copy init.vim $env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim\
   ```

4. Open Neovim and install plugins:
   ```bash
   nvim
   ```
   Then inside Neovim, run:
   ```
   :PlugInstall
   ```

5. Install CoC extensions (this will happen automatically when you open Neovim)

## Customization

The configuration includes:
- Case-insensitive search
- 4-space indentation

## Troubleshooting

1. If you see errors about missing plugins:
   - Run `:PlugInstall` inside Neovim
   - Restart Neovim

2. If CoC shows errors:
   - Make sure Node.js is installed
   - Run `:CocInfo` to check CoC status
   - Run `:CocInstall [extension]` for any missing extensions

3. If file icons are not showing:
   - Make sure you have a Nerd Font installed and configured in your terminal

4. If Telescope search is not working:
   - Verify that ripgrep is installed
   - Run `rg --version` in your terminal to confirm

For more detailed troubleshooting, check the error messages in:
- `:messages`
- `:CocInfo`
- `:checkhealth`

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Run `:checkhealth` inside Neovim to diagnose common problems
2. Check if all prerequisites are installed correctly
3. Make sure your Neovim version is 0.8.0 or higher (`:version`)
